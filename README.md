# imdb-clone

This project is similar to IMDB app where we can:
1.view what all movies are there
2.On what streaming platform is a movie present.
3.What are reviews written for each movie.
4.What is the average rating for each movie.
5.Different users who write reviews and give rating to movie.

Note: This does not involve frontend implementation of IMDB app it is all just the backend implemented.
Django rest framework is used in making of this project.
Along with core implementation, other advanced features like filtering, ordering, permissions, authentication, pagination, searching are also included in this project.
